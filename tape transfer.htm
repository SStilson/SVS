                <h2>Videotape Transfer to Digital</h2>
                <p>Stilson Video Services can transfer all types of consumer video tapes, including <strong>VHS, VHS-C, S-VHS, S-VHS-C, Betamax, BetacamSP, 3/4 Umatic, Video8, Hi8, Digital8, DV, MiniDV, MicroMV, and HDV</strong>. Often times, our customer's video tape to DVD transfer projects include more than one format which we can easily accomodate on our professional grade transfer systems. Each transfer project is handled on an individual basis to meet your specific needs.</p>
                <p>Not even sure what's on your tapes anymore? You're not alone. Stop in our studio and we can go through your tapes together to help better organize your transfer project. If video editing is required, we can certainly do that as well. Typical video editing requests include deletion of certain scenes and color correction.</p>
                <p>After your video tape to DVD transfer is complete, it's time to label and package your DVDs. Again, we have several options for you to choose from depending on your needs.</p>
                <strong>Your VHS Tapes are Fading Fast</strong>
                <p>Probably the most common format we see is the VHS tape pictured left. The VHS tape format was developed during the 1970's. During the late part of the 1970's and the early 1980's it formed one-half of the VHS vs Betamax war, which it would eventually go on to win. The VHS VCR was a mainstay in the TV-equipped living room for more than a decade, but has largely been replaced by newer technologies. By 2006, the United States had stopped releasing new movie titles in VHS format, opting for others such as DVD and Blu-ray.</p>
                <p>Therefore, throughout the 80's and early 90's, VHS was the home movie format of choice. This means that in homes all across America, millions of hours of precious family footage lie resting in attics, basements, and closets. The problem is the shelf life of VHS tape is somewhere between 15 and 20 years. This means if you have video that was shot prior to the mid-90s, you are at risk of losing those memories forever. Sadly, once the images have faded, there is no way to get them back - the information simply doesn't exist on the video tape anymore.</p>
                <strong>Take Action: Convert VHS tapes to DVD or digital files</strong>
                <p>The best course of action to prevent a tragic loss of your family memories is to convert your VHS tapes to DVD as digital files. Once that's done, you can rest easy knowing that you've stopped any degradation of quality. We also recommend that when you convert your tapes you order a back-up set of DVDs stored in another location, perhaps with a relative. This guards against the threat of flooding, fire, or any other disaster that could destroy your videotape to DVD transfer project. Contact Stilson video Services today to discuss your video tape to DVD transfer needs, and you'll be well on your way to preserving your family memories for generation to come.</p>
                <br>
                To summarize, when you convert VHS tapes to digital you enjoy the following benefits:
                <ul>
                    <li>You preserve your family's memories</li>
                    <li>You can share these memories with others</li>
                    <li>You can organize and view your video tapes more conveniently</li>
                    <li>You prevent further quality loss</li>
                    <li> You prevent losing your videos to fire or natural disasters</li>
