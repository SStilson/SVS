                <p class="lead">Whether you’re chasing your kid(s) from one sporting activity to the next, or have a general interest in recording a special game here and there, below are some basic rules of shooting that can improve your craft.</p>
                <p>With the next season fast approaching, now is the time to think about how to capture the best possible action footage on any video camera. Like anything else, practice helps; but it’s well worth the effort. Here goes:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Use a tripod!</strong> This one tip, above all others, helps create good footage. Shaky, jittery footage is very distracting and hard to watch. If a tripod is not available, try using something else to steady the camera. Or simply hold the camera close to your body and lean against a wall, fence, etc., to support yourself. A sturdy tripod is one of the best investments you can make.</li>
                    <li><strong>Turn off digital zoom.</strong> Digital zoom magnifies an image electronically, creating “pixilation” and degrading the quality of the video. Digital zoom is different from the optical zoom, which uses the lenses to bring an image closer. Learn how to turn off the digital zoom on your camera and practice using just the camera's optical zoom. And please remember that the closer you zoom-in, the more critical it is to hold the camera steady [Tip 1 above].</li>
                    <li><strong>Make sure your battery is charged.</strong> Always have a backup battery fully charged and ready to use, should the primary battery fail. Plan ahead so you can avoid the maddening frustration of a camera shutdown during an important game.</li>
                    <li><strong>If you still use tape (and that’s ok), use new, unused videotape with a clearly marked label.</strong> The cost of a new tape is a small price to pay for quality outcome. Prior to inserting a tape into the camera, affix a clearly dated and numbered sticky label that will not peel-off inside your camera. If you’re taping a lot of footage, numbering your tapes will help you keep the sequence straight when you get home. Do not use these tapes for other purposes. And don't rewind a tape in-between plays to see what you captured – wait until you get home. Rewinding during an event could cause you to miss the next play or, in a rush to start taping again, accidentally erase something that is meaningful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Establish a medium shot before moving to close-ups.</strong> A medium shot is one that encompasses the playing area and the relevant players. Close-ups are great, but when used too much or at the wrong time, important details of the play – details that highlight your athlete’s performance – can be missed. When taking wide-field shots of college-bound athletes, note that college coaches want to see the number on a player’s jersey, so don’t completely zoom-out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Set the camera high enough above obstructions.</strong> You want to be able to capture the playing surface, but be sure to keep your shooting area above or away from current and potential obstructions (i.e., people 3 rows down who do not stay seated, light poles, team mascot, etc.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Be quiet, or at least mindful of what you say.</strong> Remember that you are the closest person to the mic. In the heat of the moment, it’s easy to utter an untimely groan (or worse) when your son or daughter displays imperfection on the field. The play was bad enough without your accompanying sound affects.</li>
                </ol></p>
                <p>We wish you fun and success in creating excellent action footage, whether for posterity, a college application, or any other purpose where quality video matters. Happy shooting!</p>
