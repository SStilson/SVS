                <h2>Legal Video Services</h2>
                <strong>Video Depositions</strong>
                <p>Stilson Video Services records legal video depositions in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(3) which governs the taking of video depositions to be admitted in a court of law. We cover video depositions mainly in the greater Cleveland area and throughout northeastern Ohio as well.</p>
                <p>Legal video depositions are the best method to effectively present the visual and verbal communication cues of the witness. It is the best alternative to a live appearance of an unavailable key witness. We record video depositions with proper lighting and backgrounds. Microphones are placed on the deponent, deposing attorney(s), opposing attorney(s) and videographer.</p>
                <p> Legal video recorded depositions can be synchronized with the court reporter's written transcript. This provides a very useful tool for reviewing the video deposition and trial presentation. Our legal video depositions are recorded in professional Digital Video (DV) format, with year-month-date-day-hour-minute-seconds burned into the lower third of the image. We can provide duplicates of the original video deposition on DVD, VHS videotape, MPEG-1, or synchronized video. In addition, an audio recording is made for the convenience of the stenographic court reporter.</p>
                Legal video depositions are delivered with a Tape Log, Objections and Colloquy Log, and proper labeling and packaging. The Original video deposition is delivered to the client with a signed Certificate of Authenticity.</p>
                <strong>Activities of Daily Living Video</strong>
                <p>(Also referred to as Day-In-The-Life Video)<br>The purpose of this video is to honestly and accurately portray how the plaintiff's normal life routines have been altered as a result of his or her injury. The jury must clearly see and understand how the plaintiff's life has been changed so they are able to measure the loss. Many judges have held that video documentaries depicting the plaintiff's consequential damages are the "best from of evidence the jury has" to evaluate damages. If the jurors understand the injury and its impact, they can intelligently place a value on the case.</p>
                <strong>Mediation Documentary</strong>
                <p>(Also referred to as Settlement Brochure)<br>A mediation documentary is a concise summation of a case - usually produced on behalf of a plaintiff. The final presentation is 10 to 20 minutes long and resembles a TV style documentary. Our objective is to get the defense and insurance company to fully comprehend the pain and suffering as a result of their negligence or product liability. The presentation usually covers liability and damages and is presented during mediation or arbitration.</p>
                <strong>Video Production & Editing</strong>
                <p>In today’s media-centric society, <a href="video editing.htm">video editing</a> can really make or break a case. If it is not done well, the jury won’t be impressed. This requires a high level of expertise along with the latest tools and technology to get the job done.</p>
                <p>We use the same software and technology utilized by Hollywood to create TV shows and feature films. Top professionals in the industry have trained our editors and we are committed to ongoing training that ensures we are up to speed on the latest technologies and techniques. In short, if we can imagine it, it can probably be accomplished through video editing.</p>
                <strong>Still Photos from Video</strong>
                <p>We can take camcorder tapes or VHS tapes and convert specific points on the tapes to digital files. At that point they can be printed as photographs or archived on a CD.</p>
                <strong>Video & Audio Enhancement</strong>
                <p>It is sometimes necessary to "clean up" audio so that the content can be clearly understood in court. The same is true with video. We have the tools and skills needed to enhance most audio and video so you can use it to your best advantage.</p>
                <strong>International Conversions</strong>
                <p>We can convert PAL or SECAM format tapes to an NTSC tape or DVD (the format used in the United States). Tapes recorded overseas will usually not play in players built for the US market. Our specialized conversion equipment allows us to solve this problem for you.</p>
                <strong>Duplication Services</strong>
                <p>We can get your <a href="duplication.htm">CD and/or DVD duplication</a> order turned quickly enough to meet almost any deadline. We use only the best CD and DVDs available, utilizing the latest in technology to ensure your satisfaction. We never use labels, but instead imprint directly onto the DVDs/CDs. We can also duplicate most tape formats as well. We look forward to handling your next duplication project.</p>
